# Kolibri Fork "App with Kolibri"

This is an example of an application that starts as a fork of 
[Kolibri](https://webengineering-fhnw.github.io/Kolibri/index.html)
and develops from there.

[App with Kolibri Home Page](https://webengineering-fhnw.github.io/App-with-Kolibri/index.html)

where you find how to "install" and use the Kolibri and how
you become owner of the code without the need for any license.

Kolibri does _not_ require node.js or npm or any of such tools.

## Steps to clean up the workflow after forking
- adapt README.md
