# Kolibri Fork "App with Kolibri"

This is an example of an application that starts as a fork of 
[Kolibri](https://webengineering-fhnw.github.io/Kolibri/index.html)
and develops from there.

## Steps to clean up the workflow after forking
- adapt README.md to reflect the app that you are building
- adapt / remove kolibri docs as needed
- adapt / remove production bundling as needed (github workflow and folder)
- adapt /css /font /img /src/customize
- remove /contrib since an app does not need that
- make an /app subfolder under /src
- optional: remove the examples or keep them around for reference

## Happy Coding !
